## Python
![pythonlogo](/img/Python_logo.png)
### Description
Python is a high-level, interpreted language known for its simplicity and readability. 
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
### Features
- Dynamic typing and automatic memory management.
- Extensive standard library and a large ecosystem of third-party modules.
- Support for scripting and rapid prototyping.
### Use cases
- Web development (Django, Flask)
- Data analysis and machine learning (Pandas, NumPy)
- Automation and scripting
  

## C
![Clogo](/img/C_logo.png)
### Description
C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language.
It is known for its efficiency and control over system resources, making it popular for system-level programming.
### Features
- Low-level access to memory via pointers.
- Direct manipulation of hardware and system resources.
- A small, simple core language with direct access to API functions.
### Use cases
- Operating systems and system programming (Linux kernel, Windows)
- Embedded systems and microcontrollers
- Performance-critical applications (game engines)

## C++
![C++logo](/img/C++_logo.png)
### Description
C++ is an extension of C that includes object-oriented features.
It combines the efficiency and control of C with the added power of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
### Features
- Support for both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.
- Powerful standard library for data structures and algorithms.
- Resource management and exception handling
### Use cases
- High-performance applications like game development
- Real-time systems and application software
- Large-scale systems and infrastructure software
  

## JavaScript
![jslogo](/img/js_logo.png)
### Description
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that is a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.
It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
### Features
- Dynamic typing and first-class functions.
- Asynchronous programming capabilities with Promises and async/await.
- DOM manipulation for interactive web content.
### Use cases
- Web development (front-end frameworks like React and Angular)
- Server-side development (Node.js)
- Mobile app development (React Native, Ionic)
  

## Java
![javalogo](/img/java_logo.png)
### Description
Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for portability and cross-platform compatibility.
It follows the WORA (write once, run anywhere) principle, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
### Features
- Strong memory management with automatic garbage collection.
- Rich standard library and robust ecosystem.
- Platform independence with the JVM.
### Use cases
- Backend systems with Spring Framework
- Android mobile app development
- Large-scale financial and banking systems

## Example code snippets
### Python
```python
print("Some text.")

for i in range(5):
    print(f"Number {i}")
```
### C
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Some text.\n");

    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Number %d\n", i);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### C++
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Some text." << std::endl;

    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        std::cout << "Number " << i << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### JavaScript
```javascript
console.log("Some text.");

for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(`Number ${i}`);
}
```
### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Some text.");

        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Number " + i);
        }
    }
}
```
